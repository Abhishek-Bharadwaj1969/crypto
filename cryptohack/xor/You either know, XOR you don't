so here we have the flag format as "crypto{" as we have seen earlier so we need to use associative and make out
so we ge key as myxorke and we can add the character y to make it complete
s="0e0b213f26041e480b26217f27342e175d0e070a3c5b103e2526217f27342e175d0e077e263451150104"
q=int(s,16)
print(q)
print(len(s))
#p=s.decode('hex')
q=bytes.fromhex(s)
sr="myxorkey"*7
print(len(sr))
p=""
for i in range(42):
	p+=chr(q[i]^ord(sr[i]))
print(p)
